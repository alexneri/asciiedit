# ASCII EDIT
Welcome to ASCIIEDIT! 

ASCII Edit is a simple node.js app that lets you preview asciidoc code along with a WYSWYG Editor to change your asciidoc code.

The app features a code editor, which you can add your standard ASCIIDOC code. 

This app features two regions:

* The **Asciidoc editor** where the asciidoc code is entered and edited. 

* The **Preview** button. Click this will generate a preview of your asciidoc code in the preview box.

The **Preview box** will display a formatted preview of your asciidoc code from the **Asciidoc editor** box. This preview is editable. After completing your changes in the Preview box, click **Save** to save your changes back to the Asciidoc editor, where **your changes in the Preview box will be reflected on the Asciidoc editor** box.

## Preview of the tool

You can see a preview of this tool and test it on [my replit](https://asciiedit.alexneri.repl.co/). Beware that this will reflect any change I have on the code and can be untested.
